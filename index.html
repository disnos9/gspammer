					We all are aware of multiple tactics to spoof email addresses, but of course none of them have ever been this easy to use before. GSpammer works completely free (with limits) with Mailgun's free trial. Please note that this does require an email, phone number, and credit card or you cannot sign up.

					Please note that I or any other contributors to this project are liable for your actions with GSpammer. You are completely on your own. <strong>This project was made for educational purposes only.</strong> This is to prove the security vuernerabilites with systems in schools.

					There's some things you'll need before you are ready to begin using GSpammer. First of all, this is for <b>Educational Purposes ONLY</b>. Me, nor other contributors to this project, are liable for your actions.

					Another site of mine that you might find interesting if you're setting up a site with a free tmeplate like this is <a href="http://www.buyabutton.net">Buy a Button</a>. There, for a great price you can purchase a link to your site in the form of a button. This link will obviously provide you site with some additional traffic which is always nice! Anyway, <a href="http://www.buyabutton.net">Take a look</a>!
